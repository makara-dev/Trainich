    'network-detail' => 'Network cables are used to connect and transfer data and information between computers, routers, switches and storage area networks . These cables are essentially the carrier or media through which data flows. </br> </br> 
     There are different types of communications cables, and the appropriate type to use will depend on the structure and topology of the overall architecture of the system. The most commonly used types of communications cables are dominated by what is referred to as “twisted pair cable”. In local area networks; typically office environments, retail and commercial sites, copper communications cabling, i.e., twisted pair cable is by far the most commonly used type of cable. </br> </br>
     Twisted pair cable is used in many Ethernet networks. Comprising of four pairs of thin wires or conductors, these ‘wires’ or conductors, are contained inside of the insulation or outer sheath of the cable. Each pair is twisted into several additional twists. These twists are designed to prevent interference from other devices and indeed from other adjacent cables! </br> </br>
     Fiber optic cabling is specified where high bandwidths may be needed; especially in the data center environment and where an installation demands high capacity, typically a hospital, airports, banks….However, Fiber optic cabling is fast becoming the medium of choice for any installation that is sending high volumes of data! </br> </br>
     Of course, there are other types of cables, i.e., coaxial cable, multipart cable and of course, other types of media such as wireless, otherwise known as Wi-Fi.',

    'telephone-detail' => 'A phone system comprises multiple telephones used in an interconnected fashion that allows for advanced telephony features such as call handling and transferring, conference calling, call metering and accounting, private and shared voice message boxes, and so on. A telephone system can range from just a few telephones in a home or small business up to a complex private branch exchange (PBX) system used by mid-sized and large businesses.</br></br>
     Phone systems can function over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), over the Internet (Internet telephony or VoIP), or over a combination of the two. Business telephone systems can also be delivered as a hosted service (typically referred to as a centrex), which can free companies from having to invest in costly equipment.',
