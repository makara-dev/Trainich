     Twisted pair cable is used in many Ethernet networks. Comprising of four pairs of thin wires or conductors, these ‘wires’ or conductors, are contained inside of the insulation or outer sheath of the cable. Each pair is twisted into several additional twists. These twists are designed to prevent interference from other devices and indeed from other adjacent cables! </br> </br>
     Fiber optic cabling is specified where high bandwidths may be needed; especially in the data center environment and where an installation demands high capacity, typically a hospital, airports, banks….However, Fiber optic cabling is fast becoming the medium of choice for any installation that is sending high volumes of data! </br> </br>
     Of course, there are other types of cables, i.e., coaxial cable, multipart cable and of course, other types of media such as wireless, otherwise known as Wi-Fi.',
